## Rumor Detection Using ML/DL
In this study, we implement various previously used statistical machine learning, as well as deep learning algorithms and train them on a dataset of tweets pertaining to 5 news events. We also implement a new method using Bi-Directional LSTM to to detect if the given tweet is rumor or not, using context. After training these algorithms, it was found Bi-Directional LSTM outperforms the previously used algorihms, and DL in general, outperforms statistical Machine Learning techniques.

## Dataset used
All datasets for the purpose of this project have been taken from the Pheme Dataset.
